1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
new is used to create a new table/database while create is used to create an object in an existing table or database.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
Save since that will actually update the existing database.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
ID

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
Cat.create name:'hat'

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
I actually found last homework kind of hard just adjusting to the structure of Ruby projects and getting
used to modifying many different files and understanding how they connected.

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
This was great, really gave us some freedom. I'm not sure if I did it right, but looking things up certainly
helped.
